*"GlÃ¼ckliche Rinne"* (a questionable German translation of a subversive twist on *"Lucky Strike"*) is a statically-typed, imperative programming language developed as part of an academic course on compiler construction. I mean, what else could it possibly be? ðŸ˜„

If you've ever wondered what would happen if students were given complete freedom in designing their own programming language, then this is your answer. I was hoping for fresh approaches and innovative ideas, and I guess I got them. Whether theyâ€™re actually *sensible*... thatâ€™s another question. Maybe I should clarify expectations next time. But honestly, what wouldnâ€™t you do to make learning fun? As long as the key concepts stick, Iâ€™m willing to accept (almost) anything. I also didnâ€™t want to break my promise.

The name of this language was coined by a group of students who, by their own admission, were working very hard on their assignment... at a bar. Between drinks and cigarettesâ€”specifically, a well-known brand whose name features a bowling referenceâ€”they somehow found inspiration. A few surreal leaps of logic later (the kind you probably only understand if youâ€™re slightly stoned), they arrived at this bizarre linguistic mash-up.

As you can probably tell, Iâ€™m not exactly thrilled with the nameâ€”or the language design, for that matter. I did offer a few alternative suggestions, but the class stood firm. I wonder what the outcome wouldâ€™ve been if I had graded the assignment...
